# Cloude Economies and Billing

## Fundamentals of Pricing

There are three fundamental drivers of cost with AWS

### Compute

- Charged per hour/second
- Varies by instance type

### Storage

- Charged typically per GB

### Data Transfer

- Outbound is aggregated and charged

- Inbound has no charge (with some Exceptions)

- Charged typically per GB

## Realize volume-based discounts:

- Savings as usage increase

- Tiered pricing for service like **Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)**

- Multiple storage services deliver lower storage costs based on needs.

## AS AWS grow:

- AWS focoues on lowering cost of doing busniess.

- This practice results in AWS passing savings from economies of scale to you.

- since 2006, AWS has **lowered pricing 75** times.

- Future higher-performing resources replace current resources for no extra charge.

## Custom Pricing

- Meet varying need through custom pricing.

- Available for high-volume projects with unique requirements.

## Servies with no charge

- Amazon VPC

- Elastic BeanStalk

- Auto Scaling

- AWS CloudFormation

- AWS Identiy and Access Management (IAM)

## Total Cost of Owership

### What is Total Cost of Owership (TCO)?

### why use of TCO?

- To Compute the costs of running an entire infrstucture environment or specifi workload on-permises versus on AWS.

- To budget and build the busniess case for moving to the cloud.

### AWS pricing Calculator

Use the AWS pricing Calculator to:

- Estimate monthly costs

- Identify opportunities to reduse the monthly costs

- Models your solutions before building them

- Explore price points and Calculations behind your estimate

- Find the available instance types and contract terms that meet your needs

- Name your estimate and create and name groups of services
